git clone "http web address"
git branch (tell us how many branches are present)

git checkout branch_name

git branch command -- to check feature branch are appearing or not

git add .               --this command will add the new files to the repository
git status              --show the status of the new files 
git commit -m "message" --show the message of the updated 
git push origin         -- we have to do this
