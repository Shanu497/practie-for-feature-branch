git clone "http web address"
git branch (tell us how many branches are present)
git pull origin (will tell  updated all branches)
git checkout branch_name 
now again use the command:
git branch command -- to check feature branch are appearing or not
now we have to add and commit the new files
git add .               --this command will add the new files to the repository
git status              --show the status of the new files 
git commit -m "message" --show the message of the updated 
git push origin         -- we have to do this
 
 then we have to add the comand branches to main branch
 we use 
 git checkout  main
 git branch                  -- to check we are in main branch
git merge {feature-branch_name }          -- it will merge the feature branch files to main branches
git push origin 
git branch  -d {feature-branch_name}     --will delete the feature branch file
